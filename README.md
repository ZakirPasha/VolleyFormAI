# üèê VolleyForm AI

**VolleyForm AI** is a Python application inspired by the 2024 Olympic Games, designed to help volleyball players improve their form by analyzing key actions: Passing, Setting, Attacking, and Blocking. Using machine learning and computer vision, this app provides real-time feedback on your volleyball technique.

## What It Does
VolleyForm AI analyzes your movements and gives instant feedback to help you correct and refine your volleyball form. The app specifically targets the following areas:

- **Passing**: Detects if your arms are too high or if your elbows aren't straight.
- **Setting**: Monitors the distance between your elbows and checks if your hands are open.
- **Hitting**: Evaluates the height of your hitting elbow and the position of your guide arm.
- **Blocking**: Ensures your hands are open and positioned correctly.
