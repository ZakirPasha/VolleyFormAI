üèê VolleyForm AI
VolleyForm AI is a Python application designed to help volleyball players improve their form by analyzing key actions: Passing, Setting, Attacking, and Blocking. Using machine learning and computer vision, this app provides real-time feedback on your volleyball technique.

What It Does
VolleyForm AI analyzes your movements and gives instant feedback to help you correct and refine your volleyball form. The app specifically targets the following areas:

Passing: Detects if your arms are too high or if your elbows aren't straight.
Setting: Monitors the distance between your elbows and checks if your hands are open.
Hitting: Evaluates the height of your hitting elbow and the position of your guide arm.
Blocking: Ensures your hands are open and positioned correctly.
